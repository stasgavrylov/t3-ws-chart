# Realtime chart with T3 stack

This is a weekend project to get my feet wet with T3 stack, as well as `react-vis` library.

I was curious to build an app receiving a data stream through websockets and instantly displaying it on UI. On button press server starts to push data through websocket with 60 RPS frequency.
